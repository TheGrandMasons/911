> [!done]- camelCase
>> [!quote]- Definition:
>> Lower camel case, often referred to simply as camel case, is a naming convention primarily used in programming where multiple words are combined into one compound word. In this convention, the first letter of the combined word is in lowercase, and the initial letter of subsequent joined words is capitalized. 
>
> > [!tldr]- There are several reasons why lower camel case is widely used in programming:
> > >[!info]+ Purpose of Lower Camel Case:
> > > 1. **Readability:** It enhances readability by eliminating spaces between words, allowing for a clear distinction between individual words within a variable, function, or method name.
> > > 2. **Consistency:** It establishes a consistent pattern for naming variables, functions, and other entities within the code, promoting uniformity across the codebase.
> > > 3. **Convention:** Many programming languages and communities adopt camel case as a standard naming convention, aiding collaboration and making the codebase more understandable for other developers.
> >
> > > [!info]+ Guidelines for Using Lower Camel Case:
> > > 1. **Start with Lowercase:** The convention starts with a lowercase letter for the first word in the identifier. Subsequent words begin with an uppercase letter.
> > > 2. **Avoid Special Characters or Spaces:** There should be no spaces or special characters between the words. Only alphanumeric characters are used.
> > > 3. **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose meaningful names for variables, functions, or methods that accurately convey their purpose or functionality within the code.
> 
> > [!warn]- Examples of Lower Camel Case in Different Programming Contexts:
> > > [!example]+ Variables:
> > > ```js
> > > let myVariableName = "example"; 
> > > let numberOfStudents = 30; 
> > > let totalPrice = calculatePrice(quantity, unitPrice);
> > > ```
> >
> > > [!example]+ Functions/Methods:
> > > ```js
> > > function calculateTotalAmount() {
> > > // Function logic here
> > > }
> > > function getUserDetails() {
> > > // Function logic here
> > > }
> > > ```
> > 
> > > [!example]+ Object Instances:
> > > ```js
> > > let userInformation = new UserDetails(); let myArray = [];
> > > ```
> 
> > [!tldr]- Benefits of Lower Camel Case:
> > 1. **Clarity:** It allows for clear identification of words within an identifier, making code more understandable.
> > 2. **Consistency:** Following a consistent naming convention improves code maintainability and reduces confusion.
> > 3. **Convention Adherence:** Using a widely accepted convention like camel case makes your code more familiar to other developers, aiding collaboration.
> > 4. **Readability:** It enhances the readability of code, especially in cases where variable or function names consist of multiple words.
> >
> > In summary, lower camel case is a naming convention that promotes readability, consistency, and convention adherence within programming. Its usage contributes to writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code in various programming languages.
